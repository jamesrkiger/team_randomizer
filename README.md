**Academy Pittsburgh Team Randomizer**

This is a python script for generating random teams from an existing roster. It is based on a C# program I wrote during my time at Academy Pittsburgh to help the class save time breaking up into teams. The original was more complicated because I had arranged it to create each random team individually. In this version, though, I simply randomize the entire roster using the Fisher-Yates shuffle, then break it up into the specified number of teams.
